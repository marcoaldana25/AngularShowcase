# AngularShowcase
A repository for learning and working with Angular, targeting API's that I've developed. 

The intention of this project is to learn Angular, and target API's that I've developed to display data. Currently, the project I will target is my MusicAPI
which interacts with Spotify's Web API to retrieve user data, and various data about artists.

## Project Setup
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.3.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
You may also run `ng serve -o` to allow your browser to automatically open a window upon successful local site generation.


## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
